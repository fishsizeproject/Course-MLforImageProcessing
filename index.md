In this online course you will learn about:

1. concepts of deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and computer vision
2. how to pre-process and pre-annotate images to accelerate your ML projects 
3. how to apply data augmentation techiques 
4. how to build an image classification model with your own or example data
  

The online course will be organised as a series of recorded lectures and exercises, combined with two live Q&A sessions adapted to Europe-North America and Australia-Asia-Europe time zones.

The course is led by [Catarina Silva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catarina-ns-silva/) (Nature Research Centre, Lithuania) and [Asta Audzijonyte](https://astaaudzi.com/) (Nature Research Centre, Lithuania & University of Tasmania, Australia).
