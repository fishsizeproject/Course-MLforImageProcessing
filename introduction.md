<sub>[Course Overview](index.md) \> Introduction</sub>

# Introduction

In this section you will find information on course contents, requirements and resources.

The main **learning objectives** of this course are to:

-   Understand the fundamentals of Machine Learning (such as the difference between supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning),

-   Understand a general Machine Learning modelling workflow,

-   Pre-process and pre-annotate images to accelerate ML projects,

-   Apply data augmentation techniques and

-   Build an image classification model with your own or example data.

<br/>

Programming skill and Python

It will be useful if course participants have basic programming experience, in Python or R. The scripts used in the course are written in Python, but they are adapted to be user friendly and do not require prior Python knowledge to run them (you would naturally need Python knowledge to modify these scripts further). If you want to learn more about coding with Python a few useful resources can be found **here or here.**

## Google Colab

For this course we will use Google Colab. Colab, or "Colaboratory", is a free, cloud-based environment similar to Jupyter's network environment that allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser without the need for installation and configuration. It also provides free access to GPUs.

To start using Google Colab, you will need a Google account. Then go to Google Colab's home page [here](https://colab.research.google.com/) and you can start your own notebooks.

We will share notebooks with you, which will allow you to create a copy in your own Google directory, and modify and use it for your own purposes.

..When you open the GitHub hosted notebook in Colab, it opens a new editable view of the notebook. You can run and modify the notebook directly without worrying about overwriting the source.

A home screen of Google Colab will appear and you can either open a new Python notebook, by clicking 'new notebook' on the bottom right corner, or click 'cancel' and go to a short tutorial on how to get started with Google colab.

## Image datasets

We will provide an example dataset for you to use. This dataset is contributed by fishAL or smth. 
It would be very interesting and exciting if course participants also bring their own datasets of fish images. We would need about 100 images per species, and you can use as few as 2 species to start with. If your images can be shared publicly and you want to contribute them to the general broader species identification model, please upload them here. This way we can start building a global community contributed fish species identification model. Of course, you want to make sure that fish species in your dataset are identified correctly, otherwise your model will not be very useful (you might have heard the expression "garbage in - garbage out").

*give instructions how to prepare the images*

## Discussion forum 

Github account needed to post on the course website


## Github - check how much is needed. 

Create an account to join the discussion. 
We are keen to improve and advance this framework, so if you would like to collaborate on the FishSizeProject, please contact us

In this course, we will use an exammple dataset that is uploaded to github but you can also use your own dataset.

Colab can load public github notebooks directly, with no required authorization step.

After finishing the exercices, you will have to save your changes from within Colab. For this you can use the File menu to save the modified notebook either to Google Drive or back to GitHub. Choose File→Save a copy in Drive or File→Save a copy to GitHub and follow the resulting prompts.

To save a Colab notebook to GitHub requires giving Colab permission to push the commit to your repository.
